# JavaScript payload decoder for ZENNER's EASY PROTECT Radio smoke detector


## About
This is a payload decoder for The Things Network to interpret the payload raw. This is based on Zenner's documentation. 
* LoRa radio packet definitions version 1.13
* EASY PROTECT Radio Information for system integrators firmware v1.6.0

## [Test Decoder here.](https://studierendenwerk-ulm.github.io/payload-decoder-zenner-easy-protect-radio-lora/index.html)

### Features of the decoder
The decoder can interpret the following packet types:
* Synchronous Package 9.1 and 9.2 -> SP9.1 & SP9.2
* Asynchronous packet 1 -> AP1


### Planned Features
* synchronous packet 1 -> SP1
(The interpretation of synchronous packet 1 (SP1) has not yet been implemented. Currently the documentation there is not clear enough to implement a general interpretation.)
